# PyBer Analysis


## Overview

The goal of this analysis was to find a way to view ride sharing data and find out how to add more rides in the areas with low ride volume. I obtained the ride share data and used pandas for this task.

## Results



There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type
