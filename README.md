# PyBer Analysis


## Overview

The goal of this analysis was to find a way to view ride sharing data and find out how to add more rides in the areas with low ride volume. I obtained the ride share data and used pandas for this task.

## Results

It is clear there is a higher ride volume in urban cities, and there seems to be an untapped revenue market in rural cities.  There a few ways we can lessen the disparity between the cities.

## Analysis
By adding more drivers in rural areas, that would add more rides.  This would also cause the ride fares to decrease, which would be attractive to customers.  I would try to even out the ride shares between the suburban cities and rural cities by compensating drivers to relocate to that area.  I would not take drivers away from the urban areas as the fares are still highest here.
